=======================================================================
  With DRBD module version 8.4.5, we split out the management tools
  into their own repository at http://git.linbit.com/drbd-utils.git
  (tarball at http://oss.linbit.com/drbd)

  That started out as "drbd-utils version 8.9.0",
  and provides compatible drbdadm, drbdsetup and drbdmeta tools
  for DRBD module versions 8.3, 8.4 and 9 (prereleases as of now).

  Again: to manage DRBD 8.4.5 kernel modules and above,
  you want drbd-utils >= 8.9.0 from above url.
